# Week 4 - Interpretable Machine Learning for Data Science

This repository contains resources for the Explainable ML for Data Science part (week 4) of ISC 301.

## Settings things up

We highly recommend that you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as IDE for your
notebooks. You will also need to install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) and use it to create
a virtual environment:

```sh
poetry install
poetry run ipython kernel install --user --name=w4-xai-ds
```

## Start the assignment

Open the notebook `week4-assignment.ipynb` and select the kernel you have just created. The notebook
will guide you into the different steps to be performed for this assignment.

**IMPORTANT**: the notebook will ultimately be converted into a report, so make sure to keep it nice
and tidy all along. Take notes and describe your findings as you go.
